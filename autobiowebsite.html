          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Greetings, everyone! I am Lev Prosvietin, and I arrived in Dunn during my senior year. The conflict in Ukraine compelled me to move to America, where I had initially planned to study even before the turmoil escalated. Hailing from Ukraine's bustling capital city with a population of approximately 5 million citizens, I embarked on this journey to Dunn, marking my first-ever visit to the United States and my inaugural experience as a boarding student. It was an overwhelming amalgamation of newness.<br><br>
            Initially, I found myself perplexed by the flurry of activities and adjustments, but with the passage of time, I began to acclimate myself to the people, the culture, and the vastness of America. This immersion brought forth a multitude of novel experiences. Exploring California, I ventured into the art of surfing, discovered various genres of music, and traveled extensively to gain a deeper understanding of the state and its unique essence.<br><br>
            While basketball and volleyball were unfamiliar territories for me, and I had never before engaged in formal art classes, I wholeheartedly embraced the challenge of fitting in. With dedication and perseverance, I surprised myself by excelling in these newfound activities during my final year. In contrast, my background in karate, which I pursued for nearly a decade in Ukraine, proved instrumental in securing a place on Dunn's sports teams. However, I remain humble and avoid complacency.<br><br> Envisioning a promising future in America, I have decided to stay here and pursue a degree in computer science at college. Continuously immersing myself in American culture, I am eager to delve further into its intricacies and continue expanding my horizons.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I have been participating in sports since I was 6 years old. The very first sport I ever tried was a form of martial art called "Aikido." To be honest, I don't remember much about it because I only practiced it for a year. However, it sparked my interest in such activities. When I was around 7 years old, I started practicing Karate, and now, as I approach my 17th birthday, I have nearly a decade of experience in it. My dedication and hard work have paid off, as I have become a two-time champion of Ukraine and have won multiple titles in club and city (Kyiv) competitions. This summer, I am planning to take an exam to earn my first black belt in Karate, which will be a testament to my mastery of the art. Throughout these years, I have had the privilege of being coached by Vitalii Petrovich, who has been my only coach. His club started small but has grown into a big family, where I have found great friends and teammates. The style of Karate I practice is called "Karate Shotokan Do," which is one of the most authentic forms of Karate.<br>

            However, Karate is not the only sport I have pursued. I have also been involved in swimming at a competitive level, although I haven't achieved as much success in that sport. Nevertheless, I have participated in several championships and secured a few third and second-place finishes.
            
            Upon my arrival at Dunn school, I had never played ultimate frisbee, basketball, or volleyball before. However, I quickly excelled during the ultimate frisbee season and became fairly proficient in basketball and volleyball. I can now execute difficult maneuvers like swinging and dunking, which are challenging to accomplish.
            
            As you may have noticed from the picture on the right, I am also an artist. I have always enjoyed drawing, but I never really dedicated much time to practicing it. Surprisingly, my skills developed rapidly and naturally after joining Dunn school, and I have made significant improvements in my artistic abilities.

          <h3>Future</h3>
          <p>
            Allow me to share my aspirations for the future. While my chosen path as a computer scientist may not be my ultimate life goal, it serves as a means to achieve independence—an accomplishment I value greatly. The field of computer science offers reliable opportunities, and I find enjoyment in coding, which may lead me to further explore this vast domain. Notably, the website you are currently on was crafted entirely by me, a testament to my dedication as I invested approximately 20 hours into its creation. However, I consider myself a beginner, as there is nothing particularly remarkable about the website, and it shouldn't have taken that long.<br><br>
            In any case, I believe computer science provides a fulfilling outlet for my intellectual capabilities. Concurrently, I intend to continue pursuing sports. In the upcoming summer, I have set my sights on attaining the esteemed black belt in karate—an examination that represents one of the highest achievements in the discipline. While I may not join my college's basketball team, I will persist in practicing the sport, as it holds a special place in my heart.<br><br>
            Looking ahead, the next five to six years of my life will be pivotal, and I am determined to give my best effort in achieving everything I aspire to.</p>
